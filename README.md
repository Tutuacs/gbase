cd ~
```
Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tutuacs/gbase.git
```

```

Paste on the end of the file
```bash
export PATH=$HOME/gbase/bin:$PATH
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

All done, you can now create new projects with the command

```bash
gbase new [project_name] || gbase new .
```
Inside the path created you can run the *Generate* command

```bash
gbase g h [handler_name] || gbase generate handler [handler_name]
```
